Homework 4, Activity 1:  Learning to use Valgrind

Name: <<< Egor Kozitski: ek5442 >>>

Instructions
------------

These questions deal with the movie program found in movie.c, mtime.c and
movietest.c.  Compile these files as indicated in the assignment writeup.

We have included a compiled copy of the solution "goodmovietest" for you
to run to see how the program should behave.

The nature of these activities will have you switching back and forth
between running valgrind and looking at code. You may find it helpful to
have a second shell window open; run valgrind in the first window, and 
execute other commands (such as 'more', or an editor) in the second window.

Questions
---------

1. Run "movietest" and observe its behavior

   a. When movietest is run, what error is reported?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) 
********************
 Error in `./movietest': double free or corruption (out): 0x0000000001af6020 
***********************************************************

   b. Is the behavior of movietest consistent, if you run it multiple
      times (e.g. 5 times) does it result in the same error each time?

******************** Your answer below (5 points)
********************
After running it five times the same error occured but the address was always different 

***********************************************************

   c. Explain what a "double free or corruption" error message likely
      means. That is to say, when discussing dynamic memory management
      what does "double free" mean and why is it a problem?

******************** Your answer below (5 points)
********************

double free means that you are trying to free freed memory again by issuing malaoc 
***********************************************************

2. Use gdb to begin to investigate the error

   a. Run movietest in gdb. Look at the backtrace. It should show
      several frames of C library files followed by 2 frames in
      the movietest application. Copy and paste the last two lines 
      of the backtrace here:

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
#6  0x0000000000400cb7 in movieDelete (m=0x6030c0) at movie.c:60
#7  0x0000000000400b7e in main () at movietest.c:118

**********************************************************

   b. When the error occurs, what line of code was executing in 
      movie.c?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
movie.c:60
**********************************************************

   c. When the error occurs, what line of code was executing in
      movietest.c?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************

movietest.c:118
**********************************************************

   d. Select the stack frame pertaining to movie.c and then run the 
      "list" command to examine the source code around the line of 
      code where the error occurred. Copy and paste the result of
      running list here:

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
Breakpoint 1, main () at movietest.c:60
60          char *sglp = mtimeToString(glp) ;
(gdb) list
55          moviePlay( movie1, atime ) ;
56          mstr = movieToString( movie1 ) ;
57          printf( "After playing the movie... %s\n", mstr ) ;
58
59          mtime *glp = movieGetLastPlayed( movie1 ) ;
60          char *sglp = mtimeToString(glp) ;
61          director = movieGetDirector( movie1 ) ;
62          title = movieGetTitle( movie1 ) ;
63          printf( "The same movie referencing members is: %s by %s. Last played at: %s\n",
64                   title, director, sglp ) ;

**********************************************************
      
3. Run "movietest" using the valgrind command:
      valgrind --leak-check=full movietest
   Look at the summary information at the end of the valgrind output.

   a. How many bytes of memory are reported lost?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
 500 bytes in 12 blocks

***********************************************************

   b. How many bytes of memory are still in use when the program exited?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
500 bytes
***********************************************************

   c. How many allocation and deallocation calls were made?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
59 allocations, and 49 frees
***********************************************************

4. The output from valgrind indicates many different errors, but most
   are caused by the same statements in the program being executed
   again and again.

   a. List all the different types of errors reported by valgrind, and
      how many times each occurred.  Consider only messages printed
      before the summary of heap usage.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
invalid read size 1 = 22
invalid write size 1 = 8
invalid free() = 2
***********************************************************

   b. At what lines in the source file are the memory blocks being
      allocated?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
movietest.c :43, 76, 82, 91, 107, 108, 79, 83, 86, 94, 52, 56
***********************************************************

   c. At what lines in the source file are the invalid read and write
      accesses to the memory blocks occurring?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
write: 82, 91
read: 83, 82, 86, 91, 92, 94, 95
***********************************************************

   d. Based on this information, what is the source of the invalid read
      and write errors?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
moviecopy for invalid write, and movietostring invalid read!
***********************************************************

Given the knowledge gained from the previous question, correct these
errors and then recompile and retest the program.  The invalid memory
access errors should no longer occur.

5. Run valgrind again. Notice that after the program output valgrind
   reports two occurrences of "Invalid free()".

   a. In what function do these errors occur, and how many times is
      that function called from main()?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
movieDelete()
its called 6 times
***********************************************************

   b. How many times is free() called from inside that function itself
      (i.e., not from any other functions it calls)?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
2 times
***********************************************************

   c. What fix is needed to eliminate the "Invalid free()" message?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
free(m);
***********************************************************

Make the fix you described, re-build and re-run the program.  The "Invalid
free" errors should no longer appear.

6. In the "HEAP SUMMARY" section, there are number of error reports
   regarding lost blocks of memory.

   a. In which functions were the calls to malloc() made which allocated
      the blocks that were lost, and what data items were they allocating
      space for?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
newmovie() malloc is to allocate for the newmovie
moviegetdirector();malloc allocates string for director
moviegettitle(); malloc allocates string for title
moviecopy();malloc allocates struct for the the copy
movietoString();malloc allocates string for the movie
***********************************************************

   b. Examine the code to determine what you need to change to fix each
      of the problems. Explain your solution.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
we called the function free(mstr) movietostring in the main because we can not do that in the function itself. The function returns memory, so if you free memory before, its not returning anything. We called free(mstr) at places in main after it was  assigned, and used.
we used free(m) in the moviedelete() function because the memory was never freed after using it. 
in moviecopy() function we needed to changes the sizeof command in malloc to strlen.
***********************************************************

   c. The memory allocated by these functions is returned by them to
      the calling function; this effectively transfers the responsiblity
      for deallocating the memory to the caller as well.  Where is the
      most logical place for this memory to be deallocated?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
after assinging and then using it.
***********************************************************

Make the necessary changes to the code to correct these final errors.
At this point, if you did your work correctly, your program should run
to completion with no memory management errors detected by valgrind.
